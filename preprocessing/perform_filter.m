function data = perform_filter(data, varargin)
% perform_filter  perform a high pass filter followed by a notch filter.
% Optionally, a low pass filter can be performed as well. See below.
%   filtered = perform_filter(data, params)
%   where data is the EEGLAB data structure. filtered is the resulting 
%   EEGLAB data structured after filtering. params is an optional
%   parameter which must be a structure with optional parameters
%   'notch_freq', 'high_freq', 'high_order', 'low_freq' and 'low_order'.
%   
%   'notch_freq' is the frequency for the Notch filter where from
%   (notch_freq - 3) to (notch_freq + 3) is attenued.
%
%   'high_freq' and 'low_freq' are the frequencies for high pass filter and
%   low pass filter respectively.
%
%   'high_order' and 'low_order' are orders of filtering for high pass
%   filter and low pass filter respectively.
%
%   If params is ommited default values are used. If any field of params
%   are ommited, corresponding default values are used. If 'notch_freq' ,
%   'high_freq' or 'low_freq' are -1, notch filter, high pass filter or 
%   low pass filter are not perfomed respectively.
%
%   Default values: by default there is no low_pass filter:
%                   params.notch_freq = 50  (EU)
%                   params.high_freq = 0.5
%                   params.high_order = []  (Default value of pop_eegfiltnew)
%                   params.low_freq = -1 % low pass filtering skipped
%                   params.low_order = [] (Default value of pop_eegfiltnew)
